		Use:   "delete ([-f filename] | (<resource> [(<id> | -l <label>)]",
		Short: "Delete a resource by filename, stdin or resource and id",
		Long: `Delete a resource by filename, stdin, resource and id or by resources and label selector.

JSON and YAML formats are accepted.

If both a filename and command line arguments are passed, the command line
arguments are used and the filename is ignored.

Note that the delete command does NOT do resource version checks, so if someone
submits an update to a resource right when you submit a delete, their update
will be lost along with the rest of the resource.

Examples:
  $ kubectl delete -f pod.json
  <delete a pod using the type and id pod.json>

  $ cat pod.json | kubectl delete -f -
  <delete a pod based on the type and id in the json passed into stdin>

  $ kubectl delete pods,services -l name=myLabel
  <delete pods and services with label name=myLabel>

  $ kubectl delete pod 1234-56-7890-234234-456456
  <delete a pod with ID 1234-56-7890-234234-456456>`,
		Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
			filename := GetFlagString(cmd, "filename")
			schema, err := f.Validator(cmd)

			found := 0
			ResourcesFromArgsOrFile(cmd, args, filename, selector, f.Typer, f.Mapper, f.Client, schema).Visit(func(r *ResourceInfo) error {
				found++
				if err := kubectl.NewRESTHelper(r.Client, r.Mapping).Delete(r.Namespace, r.Name); err != nil {
					return err
				}
				fmt.Fprintf(out, "%s\n", r.Name)

			})

			}

	cmd.Flags().StringP("selector", "l", "", "Selector (label query) to filter on")
