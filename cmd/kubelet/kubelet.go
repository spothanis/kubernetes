// The kubelet binary is responsible for maintaining a set of containers on a particular host VM.
// It syncs data from both configuration file(s) as well as from a quorum of etcd servers.
// It then queries Docker to see what is currently running.  It synchronizes the configuration data,
// with the running set of containers by starting or stopping Docker containers.
