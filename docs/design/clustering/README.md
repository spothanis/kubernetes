This directory contains diagrams for the clustering design doc.

This depends on the `seqdiag` [utility](http://blockdiag.com/en/seqdiag/index.html).  Assuming you have a non-borked python install, this should be installable with

```bash
pip install seqdiag
```

Just call `make` to regenerate the diagrams.
