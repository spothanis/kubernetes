# and errexit exits on error.  Turning that into an || expression blocks the
# errexit.  But $? is still not useful because grep will return an error when it
# receives no input, which is exactly what go vet produces on success.  In short,
# if go vet fails (produces output), grep will succeed, but if go vet succeeds
# (produces no output) grep will fail.  Then we just look at PIPESTATUS[0] which
# is go's exit code.
