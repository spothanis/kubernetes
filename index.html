what:
    title: Kubernetes is...
    text: Kubernetes is an open source orchestration system for Docker 
          containers. It handles scheduling onto nodes in a compute cluster 
          and actively manages workloads to ensure that their state matches 
          the users declared intentions. Using the concepts of "labels" and 
          "pods", it groups the containers which make up an application into 
          logical units for easy management and discovery.
